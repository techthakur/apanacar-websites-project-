      <h5 class="card-title"> 2. Third-Party Car Insurance  </h5>
      <p class="card-text">  A third party car insurance only provides cover (death, disability, injury, and more) 
      against damages incurred to a third person or property. 
      It does not provide cover for you and your car. The premium of third party car
       insurance is determined by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of
        India and is revised on an annual basis. A third party cover is mandatory for driving a motor
         vehicle in India according to motor vehicle act of 1988.  </p>

       It is ideal for individuals who have more than 2-3 vehicles but utilise only one at a time.

              you against financial loss in the event of an accident or theft. 
              In exchange for your paying a premium, the insurance company agrees
               to pay your losses as outlined in your policy. </p>
